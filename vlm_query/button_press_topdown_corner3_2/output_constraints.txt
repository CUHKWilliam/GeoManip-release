### Stage 1: Close the Gripper
- **Sub-goal Constraints**:
  - <"grasp", ""> (close the gripper without grasping anything).

---

### Stage 2: Move to Ready-to-Press Position
- **Sub-goal Constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the gripper of the robot", "the center of the body of the red button of the button", "the center of the gripper of the robot is colinear with the normal of the center of the body of the red button of the button by 10 cm">.

### Stage 3: Press the Button
- **Sub-goal Constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the gripper of the robot", "the center of the body of the red button of the button", "the center of the gripper of the robot moves toward the center of the body of the red button of the button by 5 cm">.

### Flow Constraints
- **Stage 1**:
  - <"flow constraints", "stage 2"> (proceed to stage 2 after closing the gripper).
- **Stage 2**:
  - <"flow constraints", "stage 3"> (proceed to stage 3 after reaching the ready-to-press position).
