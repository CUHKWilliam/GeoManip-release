### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "press the body of the red button" involves **3 stages**:

1. **Close the gripper** (to prepare for pressing).
2. **Move to the ready-to-press position** (align the gripper with the button).
3. **Press the button** (move the gripper downward to press the button).

### Geometric Constraints and Flow Constraints

#### Stage 1: Close the gripper
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"grasp", ""> (close the gripper without grasping anything).

---

#### Stage 2: Move to the ready-to-press position
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the gripper of the robot", "the center of the body of the red button of the button", "the center of the gripper of the robot is directly above the center of the body of the red button of the button by 10 centimeters">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the normal of the gripper of the robot", "the normal of the body of the red button of the button", "the normal of the gripper of the robot is collinear with the normal of the body of the red button of the button">.

#### Stage 3: Press the button
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the gripper of the robot", "the center of the body of the red button of the button", "the center of the gripper of the robot moves toward the center of the body of the red button of the button by 5 centimeters">.
