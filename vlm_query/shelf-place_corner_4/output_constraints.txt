### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "Place the blue cube onto the shelf" involves **4 stages**:
1. Grasp the blue cube.
2. Move the blue cube to align it with the shelf.
3. Place the blue cube onto the shelf.
4. Release the blue cube.

### Stage 1: Grasp the blue cube
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"grasp", "the body of the blue cube">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the heading direction of the gripper approach of the robot", "the normal of the top surface of the blue cube", "the heading direction of the gripper approach of the robot is perpendicular to the normal of the top surface of the blue cube">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the heading direction of the gripper binormal of the robot", "the normal of the side surface of the blue cube", "the heading direction of the gripper binormal of the robot is parallel to the normal of the side surface of the blue cube">

### Stage 2: Move the blue cube to align it with the shelf
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the body of the blue cube", "the center of the opening of the shelf", "the center of the body of the blue cube is directly in front of the center of the opening of the shelf by around 10 centimeters">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the plane of the top surface of the blue cube", "the plane of the shelf opening", "the plane of the top surface of the blue cube is parallel to the plane of the shelf opening">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "the blue cube is aligned with the shelf opening"> (go to stage 3 if satisfied; go to stage 2 if not satisfied)

### Stage 3: Place the blue cube onto the shelf
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the bottom surface of the blue cube", "the top surface of the shelf", "the bottom surface of the blue cube is directly above the top surface of the shelf by around 1 centimeter">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the body of the blue cube", "the center of the shelf opening", "the center of the body of the blue cube is aligned with the center of the shelf opening">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "the blue cube is placed on the shelf"> (go to stage 4 if satisfied; go to stage 3 if not satisfied)

---

### Stage 4: Release the blue cube
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"release">
