### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "Place the blue cube onto the shelf" involves **4 stages**:
1. Grasp the blue cube.
2. Move the blue cube to align it with the shelf.
3. Place the blue cube on the shelf.
4. Release the blue cube.

### Stage 1: Grasp the blue cube
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"grasp", "the body of the blue cube">
- **Flow constraint**:
  - <"flow constraint", "goto stage 2 if grasped; retry stage 1 if not grasped">

---

### Stage 2: Move the blue cube to align it with the shelf
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the body of the blue cube", "the center of the shelf opening of the shelf", "the center of the body of the blue cube is directly in front of the center of the shelf opening of the shelf by 10 centimeters">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the plane of the top surface of the blue cube", "the plane of the shelf opening of the shelf", "the plane of the top surface of the blue cube is parallel to the plane of the shelf opening of the shelf">
- **Flow constraint**:
  - <"flow constraint", "goto stage 3 if aligned; retry stage 2 if not aligned">

### Stage 3: Place the blue cube on the shelf
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the body of the blue cube", "the center of the shelf surface of the shelf", "the center of the body of the blue cube is directly above the center of the shelf surface of the shelf by 1 centimeter">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the plane of the bottom surface of the blue cube", "the plane of the shelf surface of the shelf", "the plane of the bottom surface of the blue cube is parallel to the plane of the shelf surface of the shelf">
- **Flow constraint**:
  - <"flow constraint", "goto stage 4 if placed; retry stage 3 if not placed">

### Stage 4: Release the blue cube
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"release">
- **Flow constraint**:
  - <"flow constraint", "task complete">
