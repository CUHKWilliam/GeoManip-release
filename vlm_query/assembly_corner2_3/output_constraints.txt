### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "put the round ring into the red stick by grasping the green handle" involves **4 stages**:

1. **Grasp the green handle**.
2. **Align the round ring with the red stick**.
3. **Insert the round ring into the red stick**.
4. **Release the green handle**.
