### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "put the round ring into the red stick by grasping the green handle" involves **5 stages**:

1. Grasp the green handle.
2. Align the round ring with the red stick.
3. Insert the round ring into the red stick.
4. Release the green handle.
5. Return to the initial position.

### Stage 1: Grasp the green handle
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"grasp", "the handle of the green object">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "go to stage 2 if grasped; retry stage 1 if not grasped">

---

### Stage 2: Align the round ring with the red stick
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the round ring of the green object", "the center of the top of the red stick of the red object", "the center of the round ring of the green object is directly above the center of the top of the red stick of the red object by 2 centimeters">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the plane of the round ring of the green object", "the axis of the red stick of the red object", "the plane of the round ring of the green object is perpendicular to the axis of the red stick of the red object">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "go to stage 3 if aligned; retry stage 2 if not aligned">

### Stage 3: Insert the round ring into the red stick
- **Path constraints**:
  - <"path constraints", "the center of the round ring of the green object", "the axis of the red stick of the red object", "the center of the round ring of the green object remains collinear with the axis of the red stick of the red object">
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the bottom of the round ring of the green object", "the top of the red stick of the red object", "the bottom of the round ring of the green object is in contact with the top of the red stick of the red object">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "go to stage 4 if inserted; retry stage 3 if not inserted">

---

### Stage 4: Release the green handle
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"release">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "go to stage 5 after release">

---

### Stage 5: Return to the initial position
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the gripper of the robot", "the initial position of the robot", "the gripper of the robot returns to the initial position">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "end task after returning to the initial position">
