### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "put the basketball onto the red hoop" involves **5 stages**:

1. **Grasp the basketball**  
2. **Lift the basketball vertically**  
3. **Move the basketball over the red hoop**  
4. **Move the basketball down onto the red hoop**  
5. **Release the basketball**
