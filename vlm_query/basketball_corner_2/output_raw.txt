Below is the Python implementation of the constraints and flow control for the task "put the basketball onto the red hoop."

### <stage constraints splitter> ###
### stage 1 sub-goal constraints (grasping)
```python

    """constraints: <"grasp", "the body of the basketball">"""
    return grasp("the body of the basketball")

```python
