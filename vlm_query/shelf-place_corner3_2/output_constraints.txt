### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "Place the blue cube onto the shelf" involves **4 stages**:
1. Grasp the blue cube.
2. Move the blue cube above the shelf.
3. Place the blue cube on the shelf.
4. Release the blue cube.

### Stage 1: Grasp the blue cube
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"grasp", "the body of the blue cube">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "goto stage 2 if grasp is successful; goto stage 1 if not successful">

---

### Stage 2: Move the blue cube above the shelf
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the body of the blue cube", "the center of the top surface of the shelf", "the center of the body of the blue cube is directly above the center of the top surface of the shelf by 10 centimeters">
- **Path constraints**:
  - <"path constraints", "the body of the blue cube", "the body of the shelf", "the body of the blue cube does not collide with the body of the shelf during movement">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "goto stage 3 if position is achieved; goto stage 2 if not achieved">

### Stage 3: Place the blue cube on the shelf
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the bottom surface of the blue cube", "the top surface of the shelf", "the bottom surface of the blue cube is in contact with the top surface of the shelf">
  - <"sub-goal constraints", "the center of the body of the blue cube", "the center of the top surface of the shelf", "the center of the body of the blue cube aligns with the center of the top surface of the shelf">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "goto stage 4 if placement is successful; goto stage 3 if not successful">

---

### Stage 4: Release the blue cube
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  - <"release">
- **Flow constraints**:
  - <"flow constraint", "end task if release is successful; goto stage 4 if not successful">
