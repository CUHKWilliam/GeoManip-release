### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "put the round ring into the red stick by grasping the green handle" involves **5 stages**:

1. Grasp the green handle of the round ring.
2. Align the round ring with the red stick.
3. Insert the round ring into the red stick.
4. Release the round ring.
5. Retract the robot gripper.
