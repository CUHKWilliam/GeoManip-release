### Task Decomposition and Flow Control

The task "press the body of the red button" involves **3 stages**:

1. **Close the gripper** (to prepare for pressing).
2. **Move to the ready-to-press position** (align the gripper with the red button).
3. **Press the red button** (move the gripper toward the button).
